/*
191. Number of 1 Bits
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns
 the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation
 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
