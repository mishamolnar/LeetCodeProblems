137. Single Number II
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/description/

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
