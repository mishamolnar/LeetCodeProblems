 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
 https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/?tab=Description

 Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

 Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last,
 is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far
 left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
