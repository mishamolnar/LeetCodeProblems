/**
 509. Fibonacci Number
 The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
 such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

 F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
 F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
 Given N, calculate F(N).
